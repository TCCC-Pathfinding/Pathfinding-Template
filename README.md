# Pathfinding-Template
OpenStreetMap template with startup code.

[Live Demo](https://tccc-pathfinding.github.io/Pathfinding-Template/)

## What You're Given

For this project, you are being provided with a JS file which renders the page and a Python file which fetches your requisite data. Note that you will not need to run the python file at all if you are not extending the restaurant list - all of the data you'll need for the given restaurants is there; if you'd like to extend the functionality and add additional restaurants, you'll need to re-run the python script.

The implementation of the pathfinding algorithm will be in the JS file. Note that you are entitled (even encouraged) to alter and enhance as much as you want. Many of you will have done similar projects in low/mid-level coursework in the past, so we're confident you can do the algorithm. To differentiate this project from those, and to help you differentiate yourself from everyone else, we want this project to emphasize your **creativity**!

We encourage you to work on this project on your own PCs, since some of the dependencies may be a headache to use on your dev VPCs.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at agindi@mtb.com and be sure to include **TCCC** (Tech Connect Coding Challenge) somewhere in the subject.
